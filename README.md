# Snaking Bad 👨‍🔬
This is a Breaking Bad themed "Snake" game that I decided to create in order to gain more experience using React as well as Redux. I am currently working on this project and will provide a more thorough README once it has been deployed
 
 ## Main Goal ✅
My main goal for this project is to learn about Redux (which I have not yet used) by relying on it for altering the state of the game. I am fairly certain that the small size of this project does not necessarily require Redux; nonetheless, I felt that beginning with a smaller app would be a good place to start.
